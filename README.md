# VAPXML
This markdown file holds infomation and records of VAPXML, development of a new input format for future versions of VAP. Similar to previous input files, parameters of the flight vehicle geometry are stored in ASCII text file but in XML 1.0 language. This will provide freedom for future versions of VAP and enable analysis of complex vechicle geometry and configuration. 


# VAPXML File Format Specifications
## Legend
- (\*)  Multiple Entry
- [FW] Parameter exists in FreeWake
- [VAP2] Parameter introduced to VAP2
- [VAP3] Parameter introduced to VAP3

## Notes
### Default Unit
All numerical input would have a default unit assigned. (e.g. meters for the reference span). This can be setup with a `unit` tag under the numerical parameter such that specific units can be converted to the default unit in *future* VAP releases.

For example:
`<span unit='feet'>5</span>` 

would yield the same result as
`<span>1.524</span>`

# VAP
The MATLAB version of the higher-order potential flow code FreeWake.

Branches:
- Master
    - Working version of VAP2.0
    - Optimized to make use of MATLAB's features

- VAP1.0
    - Contains files as copied from the C++ version of FreeWake into MATLAB
	- Provides similar results to the C++ version of FreeWake, but runs slow
    - Known issues with VAP1.0:
        - If relaxing the wake, the very first row of elements emitted (timestep 0) are not connected to the second row. 
        - Splits in the wings are not handled correctly.
